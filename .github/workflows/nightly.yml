# The following aims to reduce CI CPU cycles by:
# 1. Cancelling any previous builds of this PR when pushing new changes to it
# 2. Cancelling any previous builds of a branch when pushing new changes to it in a fork
# 3. Cancelling any pending builds, but not active ones, when pushing to a branch in the main
#    repository. This prevents us from constantly cancelling CI runs, while being able to skip
#    intermediate builds. E.g., if we perform two pushes the first one will start a CI job and
#    the second one will add another one to the queue; if we perform a third push while the
#    first CI job is still running the previously queued CI job (for the second push) will be
#    cancelled and a new CI job will be queued for the latest (third) push.
